# Project: Adult_Income Analysis

## Description
The Adult income dataset analysis is a data analysis project that explores the Adult income dataset, a public dataset containing demographic and income data for a set of individuals. The goal of the project is to gain insights into the factors that influence income, identify patterns, and make predictions about future income levels. The project duration was less than a month.

## Detailed Analysis
The project examines various aspects of the Adult income dataset, including:
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examines the correlation between numerical variables using a correlation matrix and heatmap.
- **Distribution of Age**: Analyzes the distribution of the age column.
- **Education and Income Relationship**: Investigates how education level affects income.
- **Work Class and Age Distribution**: Analyzes the distribution of work class and age.
- **Educational Degrees**: Counts the number of people with a Bachelor's or Master's degree.
- **Bivariate Analysis**: Examines relationships between pairs of variables.
- **Enhanced Income Visualization**: Adds columns to better show income values and visualizes the distribution.
- **Income Distribution by Class and Sex**: Analyzes income distribution across different classes and sexes.

## Visualizations
The project uses data visualization to understand the distribution and relationships within the dataset. Examples include:
- **Bar Chart:** Distribution of income by age.
- **Bar Plot:** Relationship between education level and income.
- **Histogram:** Distribution of age.
- **Histogram:** Distribution of work class.

## Conclusion
The analysis reveals significant patterns and relationships in the dataset, providing insights into income distribution and factors influencing income levels. The visualizations and detailed analysis contribute to a deeper understanding of the data and its implications.
